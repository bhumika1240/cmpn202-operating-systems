## Week 6 – Performance Evaluation & Analysis

## Performance Evaluation and Analysis of Operating System Behaviour
## 1. . Introduction

The aim of this experiment is to evaluate the performance of a Linux-based operating system under different workloads. The system behaviour was analysed by monitoring CPU usage, memory utilisation, disk I/O performance, network behaviour, system latency, and response times. Testing was conducted using baseline measurements, load testing, bottleneck identification, and optimisation techniques to understand how the operating system manages system resources under varying conditions.

## 2.Testing methodology
- Baseline performance testing
- Application load testing
- Performance analysis and bottleneck identification
- Optimisation testing and retesting

Built-in Linux monitoring tools were used due to restricted network access within the virtual machine environment.

## 3. Baseline Performance Testing

Baseline testing was conducted to observe system behaviour in an idle state with no additional workload applied.

## 3.1 CPU Baseline

The 'top' command was used to monitor CPU utilisation and system load average.

## Observation:
The CPU usage was minimal, with most CPU time spent in the idle state. Load averages remained low, indicating no processing bottlenecks.
