## Week 6 – Performance Evaluation & Analysis

## Performance Evaluation and Analysis of Operating System Behaviour
## 1. . Introduction

The aim of this experiment is to evaluate the performance of a Linux-based operating system under different workloads. The system behaviour was analysed by monitoring CPU usage, memory utilisation, disk I/O performance, network behaviour, system latency, and response times. Testing was conducted using baseline measurements, load testing, bottleneck identification, and optimisation techniques to understand how the operating system manages system resources under varying conditions.

## 2.Testing methodology
Baseline performance testing

Application load testing

Performance analysis and bottleneck identification

Optimisation testing and retesting


Built-in Linux monitoring tools were used due to restricted network access within the virtual machine environment.
