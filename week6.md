## Week 6 – Performance Evaluation & Analysis

### Performance Evaluation and Analysis
This week focuses on evaluating the performance of the Linux server operating system under different workloads. Performance evaluation involves measuring how system resources such as CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network bandwidth are used during normal operation and under increased load. Performance analysis is then used to interpret this data, identify system bottlenecks, and understand how configuration choices impact overall system efficiency, stability, and responsiveness.
